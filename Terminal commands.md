# Terminal commands 
- **ls**
 is the list command of what’s inside the current directory
- **ls - l**
-**l** is short for long, giving more info like the user that created it …
clear cleared the terminal, but not for good
- **ls - a** shows the folders and files, some start with a dot showing a hidden folder/file from the user so the user cannot access it as to not break the system
- **ls -al** gives you the long form information of it all
- **cd** followed by the place you want to go to is for change directory e.g -**cd** Documents press enter to get to documents
- **pwd** shows where we are so in this case should end in /documents
So then if we were to click ls it’ll list the content of my documents folder
- **cd ..** (don’t forget the space) takes you back up a level back into the folder/file you were in before 
- **cd** by itself will take you right back to your home directory 
- **Tab** key autocompletes the word for you
- **mkdir** = make directory followed by file name
E.g mkdir my_directory
Cant have a / or a . when naming directories as / is for differentiating between directories and . are for file extensions
- **Touch** to make a file e.g touch my_file.txt we need to include a type of extension
Another example being a picture touch my_picture.png
could also touch another_file and that will work too
Can add multiple files at a time by touch file_1 file_2
- **mv** short for move file, needs object and location it’s moving to 
e.g ->my_directory mv my_picture.png pictures this will move the my_picture to the picture folder
mv can also be used for renaming by not allocating a location for the file to move to, e.g mv another_file another_file.xlsx
Can't move multiple files at once
- **cp** copies the file
- **rm** (remove) to delete e.g rm another_file.xlsx, rm doesn’t move to trash, fully deletes it 
Can't just use rm to delete a directory e.g pictures, will alert you that it’s a directory 
- **rm -r** (directory name) will delete the directory altogether
Relative file path, relative to where we are right now
Absolute file path, start somewhere and move to elsewhere (can move anything we want to anywhere in the system- valuable)
(~) in the beginning will be an absolute file path
